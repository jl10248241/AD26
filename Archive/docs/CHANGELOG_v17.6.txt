College AD – CHANGELOG (v17.6)
Date: 2025-10-29
Author: Development Build Assistant

------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:
Major milestone introducing the Donor Memory System and
Assistant AD (AAD) Dialogue prototype.
------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FILES:
+ engine/src/aad_dialogue.py
+ engine/src/seed_donors.py
+ data/donors.json
+ data/donors.summary.json
+ logs/DONOR_LEDGER.csv
+ docs/PROJECT_STATUS_v17.6.md
+ docs/CHANGELOG_v17.6.txt

UPDATED FILES:
* engine/src/run_tick.py – verified donor hooks stable
* engine/src/donor_report_plus.py – generates relationship metrics
* docs/FINANCE_TRENDS.md – refreshed output structure
* .env – ensures DATA_DIR and LOG_DIR paths defined

REMOVED / DEPRECATED:
– None

CORE UPGRADES:
- Added donor tracking persistence (trust, leverage, pledges)
- Introduced donor relationship summaries and risk / opportunity flags
- Expanded Analyzer for donor metrics and insights
- Implemented natural-language output conversion in AAD assistant
- Enabled multiple donors and schools (State U + 131 schools)
- All analyzer and finance systems verified stable with CSV output

INTERACTIVE AAD FEATURES:
- Responds to player queries via PowerShell or console
- Recognizes natural language for:
  "how are donor relationships", "who’s at risk",
  "list opportunities", "tell me about [School]"
- Produces conversational feedback (e.g. “Start small, low-ask…”)
- Dynamic text scoring: Excellent, Good, Fair, Wobbly, At-Risk

NEXT BUILD TARGETS (v17.7):
- Donor Memory Fade system
- Cross-AI communication (Coaches, Board, Donors)
- Donor stipulation + reputation effect tracking
- Early UI/UX mockups for AD communication screen

NOTES:
This version represents a fully stable baseline for the v18
AI-driven expansion. All finance, logging, and donor subsystems
function independently and integrate cleanly.
