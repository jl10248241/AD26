# College AD Project Setup Instructions
# Version 1.1 — 2025-10-27

---

## 🧭 PURPOSE

This file provides **setup and initialization instructions** for the `College AD Development Hub (Core Build)` project.  
It works in tandem with the **Developer Edition Design Document** to establish a clean, efficient, and persistent development workspace.

---

## ⚙️ STEP 1 — CREATE THE PROJECT

1. Open a **new ChatGPT conversation**.
2. Title it exactly:  
   👉 “College AD Development Hub (Core Build)”
3. Upload both of these files:
   - `College_AD_Game_Design_Document_v1.0_(Developer_Edition).md`
   - `College_AD_Project_Setup_Instructions_v1.1.txt` (this file)

---

## 🧱 STEP 2 — INITIALIZE THE CORE FRAMEWORK

Once both files are uploaded, type the command below:

> “Initialize the project using the uploaded Developer Edition document and setup instructions.”

This command will:
- Load the `.md` document as the **design blueprint**
- Load this `.txt` as the **operational playbook**
- Establish persistent developer memory for:
  - REG Engine
  - Recruiting System
  - Financial Snapshot
  - Meeting System
  - NCAA Ecosystem
  - Coach Trait & AI Frameworks

---

## 🧩 STEP 3 — ENABLE DEVELOPER MODE

After initialization, type:

> “Enable Developer Mode for College AD.”

This activates:
- Build version tracking (v16 → onward)
- Task management and changelog history
- Debug/patch testing support
- Tier-based workflow tracking (Tier 1, 2, 3)

---

## 🧠 STEP 4 — WORKFLOW REFERENCE

| Task Type | Example Command | Description |
|------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Design Expansion** | “Expand Charisma trait with modifiers.” | Adds mechanics and gameplay impact. |
| **Code Integration** | “Generate Engine_v17 macro.” | Produces ready-to-paste Excel VBA. |
| **Testing / Debug** | “Simulate NCAA week cycle.” | Runs logical test using systems. |
| **Documentation** | “Update Developer Doc to v1.1.” | Generates a new markdown with changelog. |

---

## 🧾 STEP 5 — MAINTENANCE COMMANDS

| Command | Function |
|----------|-----------|
| `Show Task Tracker` | Displays active development goals. |
| `Add Task "<description>" [tier=x]` | Adds a new development objective. |
| `Generate Build Report` | Summarizes all design/code changes. |
| `Archive to PDF` | Creates a permanent snapshot of current version. |

---

## ✅ STEP 6 — BEGIN DEVELOPMENT

Once initialized, type:

> “Let’s continue developing Charisma and Coach Trait systems.”

That resumes development from the last point in the old thread, now in a fully organized, fast, and persistent workspace.

---

## 🧩 STEP 6A — DEVELOPMENT SESSION STARTUP CHECK (MANDATORY)

Before continuing active development, always begin a new session by asking:

> **“Evaluate our game so far — where are we strong, where are we weak, and where are we meh?”**

This step:
- Produces a fresh **system-level health report** across all major gameplay pillars  
- Compares current build vs. previous version snapshot (e.g., v17.2 → v17.5)  
- Updates the **Rolling Task List** automatically with new strengths/weaknesses  
- Reinforces consistent self-awareness across builds  

**Developer Note:**  
The long-term trend should show “weak” → “meh” → “strong” transitions as systems mature.  
This diagnostic anchors our momentum and prevents tunnel vision when new features expand.

## 🧩 FILE SUMMARY

| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| `College_AD_Game_Design_Document_v1.0_(Developer_Edition).md` | Master Design Blueprint |
| `College_AD_Project_Setup_Instructions_v1.1.txt` | Initialization and Workflow Protocol |

---

## ⚙️ NOTES FOR FUTURE BUILDS

- Always **version new design docs** (`v1.2`, `v1.3`, etc.) before major revisions.
- Keep code and design in **separate modules** within the new environment.
- When ready for the next milestone (Engine_v17+), create a **Stable Snapshot** via `Archive to PDF`.
